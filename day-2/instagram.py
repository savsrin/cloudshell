#We are looking at instagram account profiles.
#1. Come up with 2 more relevant pieces of information to add to the profile.
elissa = {"name": "Elissa Levy", "username": "elevy", "email": "elevy@madeupdomain.com", "birthday": "August 19", "followers": 0}
#2. Create (at least) 3 more profiles like this - one for you, one for your partner, and one for a pet or family member or famous person.
#3. Ask the user which profile they want to look up, and print that person's entire profile.
#4. Write code that prints their birthday in a sentence, such as "Elissa Levy has a birthday of August 19" - for whichever profile the user chose in #3.
